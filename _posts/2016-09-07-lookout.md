  <p>The opportunity to secure the connected world is incredibly huge, especially when you consider that more people already have access to smartphones than to electricity. As part of the design team at Lookout, I create software that protects the devices of over 100 million people and businesses all over the world.</p>
  <p>At Lookout, we’re obsessed with creating security products people want to use on their devices, and each of us has a direct impact on creating security that’s simple, beautiful, and not scary. Turning our predictive security technology into products that are sophisticated yet user-friendly is a huge challenge, and it’s all about collaborative problem-solving.</p>
