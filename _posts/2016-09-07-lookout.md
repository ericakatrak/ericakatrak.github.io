  <p>The opportunity to secure the mobile world is incredibly huge. More people already have access to smartphones than to electricity, and in 2016, 67% of organizations - of all sizes - reported data breaches from mobile devices.</p>
  <p>At Lookout, we asked a lot of questions. How might we turn our predictive security technology into products that are sophisticated, yet user-friendly? That are simple, beautiful, and not scary? That people want to use? How might we craft security products that are centered around freedom, and not restrictions?</p>
  <p>To bring top-notch security products to the masses, I partnered with business, engineering, and marketing groups to design, build, and launch a suite of mobile, enterprise-focused security apps - protecting sensitive personal and company data against malware, network attacks, vulnerabilities, and behavioral risks.</p>

  <p>To build a product that would scale and enable fast and flexible iterations, one of the first big initiatives was to design and implement a cohesive design system, and using that design system, reimagine basic existing flows like the sign in experience to more complex flows like filtering data.</p>
  <p>With the product strategically redesigned, we were able to continue to extend it and quickly build other tools to form a suite of security products that could work together like legos. We did this in phases - we started minimally with an eye towards the future, and as we gained traction, built in more features.</p>
  <p>We began with a design partner program - our customers could get early access at a discount in exchange for helping us understand what information and functionality we needed to focus on first. We discussed and we iterated, and from there, I created mocks with our new system components. We tested - we pivoted - we tested again - I created new mocks and extended the design system - and then I partnered side-by-side with our security, backend, and front end engineers to implement.</p>
  <p>Based on what we learned from our early customers and partners, we set foundations for future products, and we launched new features like the ability to upload your own app - for companies that need to test the security of their in-house products - and powerful custom policy creation, allowing customers to automate a lot of their previously manual security processes.</p>
<p>As always, a ton of collaborative sketching, posting, mapping, scrapping, and other fun stuff with markers went into creating what we created.</p>
