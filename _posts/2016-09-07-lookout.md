  <p>The opportunity to secure the connected world is incredibly huge, especially when you consider that more people already have access to smartphones than to electricity.</p>
  <p>To bring top-notch security products to the masses, I partnered with business, engineering, and marketing groups to design, build, and launch a suite of mobile, enterprise-focused security apps - protecting sensitive personal and company data against malware, network attacks, vulnerabilities, and behavioral risks.</p>
