  <h2>Role: Design Lead <span class="lt">/</span> Year: 2016</h2>
  <p>The opportunity to secure the mobile world is incredibly huge. More people already have access to smartphones than to electricity, and in 2016, 67% of organizations - of all sizes - reported data breaches from mobile devices.</p>
  <p>At Lookout, we asked a lot of questions. How might we turn our predictive security technology into products that are sophisticated, yet user-friendly? That are simple, beautiful, and not scary? That people want to use? How might we craft security products that are centered around freedom, and not restrictions?</p>
  <p>I was brought on to build and scale a suite of enterprise security products. I was attracted to the space because it’s filled with gnarly and important problems to solve… it’s generally an un-shiny industry where great design can have huge impact.</p>
  <p>Lookout has some incredible technology and the largest mobile cyber-threat dataset in the world. To bring top-notch security products to the masses, I partnered with business, engineering, and marketing groups to design, build, and launch a suite of mobile, enterprise-focused security apps that could work together like Legos - protecting sensitive personal and company data against malware, network attacks, vulnerabilities, and behavioral risks. Lookout's enterprise suite is now used by large companies all over the world to protect sensitive personal and corporate data.</p>

<p>As always, a ton of collaborative sketching, posting, mapping, scrapping, and other fun stuff with markers went into the creation of these products.</p>
