  <p>The opportunity to secure the mobile world is incredibly huge. More people already have access to smartphones than to electricity, and in 2016, 67% of organizations - of all sizes - reported data breaches from mobile devices.</p>
  <p>At Lookout, we asked a lot of questions. How might we turn our predictive security technology into products that are sophisticated, yet user-friendly? That are simple, beautiful, and not scary? That people want to use? How might we craft security products that are centered around freedom, and not restrictions?</p>
  <p>To bring top-notch security products to the masses, I partnered with business, engineering, and marketing groups to design, build, and launch a suite of mobile, enterprise-focused security apps - protecting sensitive personal and company data against malware, network attacks, vulnerabilities, and behavioral risks.</p>
