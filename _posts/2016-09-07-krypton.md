  <h2>Role: Co-founder, Designer <span class="lt">/</span> Year: 2015</h2>
  <p>Despite having over 20 years of cumulative experience in the tech industry, my partner and I often found ourselves unsure of how private our digital lives were... or how to really keep tabs on it. We founded <a href="{{ site.url }}/kr36.html">Kr36</a> and with our combined skills in security, engineering, strategy, and design, we built a privacy-focused browser to solve that: Krypton Anonymous.</p>
  <p>Krypton Anonymous was the world's most private web browser. It came bundled with Tor, mitigated common fingerprinting techniques, used HTTPS Everywhere, and defaulted to the Duck Duck Go search engine. It never saved data about you or your browsing habits... it was a locked-down experience for when you want to be sure of your privacy. It was designed for secure browsing, with a minimal UI that gets out of your way. The app icon's three shapes and six sides give a nod to elemental roots (Krypton's elemental number is 36) yet also resembles a box, intended as a subtle signal of data containment.</p>
  
  <p>At its peak, Krypton Anonymous had tens of thousands of avid fans around the world and a 4.8/5 rating in the app store.</p>
    
  <h3>Some of my favorite customer quotes</h3>
  <blockquote>This is everything I hoped for. I wish the internet was all designed this way.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Pretty much perfect! So far I don't have ANY complaints. This browser is super nice looking, I love the fact that the URL bar is at the bottom (helps us people with 5+ inch phones). I'm looking forward to seeing how this product evolves.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Bravo!!! Congratulation for this great browser. The best. Combining TOR, DuckDuckGo, HTTPS, even Ad Block is brilliant. The minimalistic layout is innovative and pleasant. The great speed makes it efficient. Keep improving it.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Holy grail. Works amazing and smooth as hell. On a 1gig ram device. It values privacy, so don't expect Chrome features.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>#1 Tor browser</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Security for the layman… without comprising actual security for ease of use.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Thank you for doing this. From a person looking for freedom in China.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>Brilliant and simple to use.</blockquote>
  <blockquote>I love you.</blockquote>

  <p>Although we are very passionate about the need for elegant and powerful products focused on privacy and security, we've now retired Kr36, as we were unable to make the proper time for it outside of our full-time jobs.</p>
