  <h2>Role: Designer <span class="lt">/</span> Year: 2012</h2>
  <p>As part of the Design Systems Group, I designed site-wide design standards, frameworks, and patterns for eBayâ€™s multi-channel shopping experience, and was part of a small team that led design for a new design system to unify and update eBay's brand and look-and-feel across the site.</p>
  <p>We led design workshops across the company and partnered with <a href="http://freeassociation.is" target="_blank">FreeAssociation</a> to generate initial concepts based on new brand attributes.</p>
  <p>With the leading concepts, we conducted some scrappy testing with our users in the US, UK, and Germany. One of the concepts was a clear winner with our users, and we began to iterate. This led my team to create a completely revised visual design system, and a worldwide redesign of eBay.com. Once we had new design patterns for every core interaction of the site, we held more workshops throughout the company to redesign key workflows.</p>
  <p>With revised brand attributes, a fresh new look, a <a href="{{ site.url }}/epl.html">robust library of design patterns</a>, and the front-end code to match, we re-launched eBay.com six months later. The team at eBay is still working on streamlining fifteen years of legacy back-end code to really do the site justice.</p>
