  <p>Every year, 1.3 million people Google &quot;how do I start a business&quot;. The solutions they typically arrive to consist of dauntingly verbose information from sba.gov, and fluffy articles from sites like Mashable about coming up with business ideas. There are so many compliance rules at the federal, state, and local levels that it's easy to get tripped up. Small business owners often can find themselves in a place where they're fined and penalized for something they didn't even know they needed to do. Our goal was to create a solution to cut through the noise, spur people to action, and give people more peace of mind as they set up their business.</p>

  <p>We began with robust internal research on the tasks and pain points common to business owners who are just starting out. After we clearly defined the problem and what to solve for, we dove into an analogous research exercise... were there other experiences that are similarly as daunting and require a lot of know-how in a short amount of time? We came up with examples such as purchasing a house, having a baby, and moving to a new country.</p>
  <p>After we found the best online resources in those areas, we looked for patterns and inspiration. Building on our knowledge-base and the insights gleaned from the analogous research, we then mapped out the experience, sketched a lot of ideas, and narrowed in on what was working. And because this tool was coming from QuickBooks, a company that offers many small business solutions, we wanted to be careful to not come off as salesy, but rather as helpful experts.</p>
  <p>Through the design phase, we made quite a few assumptions that we wanted to test, so we formed a fake consultancy called &quot;Project Launchpad&quot;. We made t-shirts, a sign, and set up a booth in a public space outside of the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center to test a few scrappy prototypes.</p>
  <p>We wanted to see if people came away with a greater understanding of how to set up a business, and whether or not that clarity would drive them to action - would they start setting up their business right then and there? Additionally, would they guess that a company like Intuit was behind the product? And how would that affect how they perceived the content? We received a ton of great feedback that we incorporated into the next iteration, and lots of people actually tried to set up businesses with Project Launchpad. We even had some interest from a venture capitalist :P</p>
  <p>Now post-launch, people all across the United States use the site to guide them in setting up their business.</p>
