  <p>During my time at eBay, I designed, developed, and launched a robust worldwide pattern library coinciding with the <a href="{{ site.url }}/ebay.html">eBay redesign efforts</a>. By treating design patterns, research "snippets", accessibility best practices, and voice and tone guidelines as independent information nodes, we were able to map the relationships between lots of different information. This streamlined the amount of upkeep the library required and enabled us to provide a lot more context around the guidelines to show how everything works together.</p>
  <p>We presented the strategy and process behind eBay's pattern library at several international conferences. We were featured on SlideShare's homepage, and are still answering questions from and giving advice to designers around the globe. Below are a few slides.</p>
