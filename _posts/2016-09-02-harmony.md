  <p>The QuickBooks Design Toolkit is the single source of truth for the <a href="{{ site.url }}/quickbooks.html">Harmony Design System</a>, which is used by Intuit employees and third party partners around the world to design the QuickBooks ecosystem of products.</p>
  <p>I designed, built, and launched the Harmony Toolkit in three short months. I designed in the browser and iterated live with the designers who use it the most. Last I checked, the toolkit hosts 20+ authors, 15+ design frameworks, 60+ patterns, vibrant community involvement, and a much easier maintenance plan for the evolution of ecosystem design at Intuit.</p>
  <p>Designers tell me itâ€™s the best internal tool they use, and that it really helps them understand how to design within an ecosystem of products. Third party developers tell me it's an "awesome resource" to use as they build products that work seamlessly with QuickBooks. I've since passed it on to others and it continues to evolve and scale.</p>
