  <p class="meta">Role: Co-founder, Designer <span class="lt">/</span> Year: 2015</p>
  <p>In 2014, my partner and I formed a company called Kr36, makers of software with scruples, and proponents of digital privacy. Under the Kr36 umbrella, we launched a super private Android browser: <a href="{{ site.url }}/krypton.html">Krypton Anonymous</a>.</p>
  <p>Design can play a huge role in how a company is perceived, and as the design half of Kr36, I wanted to establish an aesthetic that fit us, our ideals, and what we wanted to accomplish with Kr36. Straightforward, minimalist, just slightly nerdy, no-nonsense with a touch of globally accessible humor.</p>

  <p>Although we are very passionate about the need for privacy and security products, we've now retired Kr36, as we were unable to make the proper time for it outside of our full-time jobs.</p>
